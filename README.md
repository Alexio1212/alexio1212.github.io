Game collection <br>
In active development
<br>

<br>
You can copy this onto your own domain, mostly not my code anyways <br> <br>
Copy any ruffle game Ex: "papaspizzeria", replace the .swf name in index.html and .swf file <br>
(Only if you wanna change the game) <br> <br>
Otherwise, that's it, go nuts. No name/file changing required
